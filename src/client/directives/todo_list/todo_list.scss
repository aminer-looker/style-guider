// Each directive gets its very own SCSS file in which all rules are scoped to that specific directive (as
// you see below).  Inside, you'll generally find a section for each element included inside the template
// in the same order as the template.  Layout is done almost exclusively with flexbox.  The CSS for a child
// directive is only specified up to the border of the child.  Any CSS which affects the internals of the
// child directive should be in the child's own SCSS file.  Anything which affects the size or positioning
// of the child belongs in the parent's file.
//
// Within each selector, we try to group similar-purposed CSS rules together:
//
//   * layout rules (e.g., flex, height, margin)
//   * formatting rules (e.g., border, background, font-family)
//   * child layout rules (e.g., `display: flex`, align-items, padding)
//
// After the rules for the current item follow selectors for child elements.  Psuedo-selectors attached to
// the current element first, then followed by children in the same order they are declared in the template.
// Finally, alternate styles (e.g., &.styleClass) for the element come last, and generally repeat internal
// elements as necessary to create the proper alternate style.
